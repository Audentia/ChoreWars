# ChoreWars
Summary

Chore Wars is a focused app to assign chores to your roommates and compete with each other for prizes. The target audience is college students and young couples and it tries to make mundane parts of life a bit more fun. The main skills Iâ€™m using and learning more of are Core Data, UIKit and UIKit Dynamics, and eventually Parse.

This project is not yet complete and I am actively working on it
